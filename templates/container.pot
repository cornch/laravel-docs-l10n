msgid "In this example, the `UserController` needs to retrieve users from a data source. So, we will **inject** a service that is able to retrieve users. In this context, our `UserRepository` most likely uses [Eloquent](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent) to retrieve user information from the database. However, since the repository is injected, we are able to easily swap it out with another implementation. We are also able to easily \"mock\", or create a dummy implementation of the `UserRepository` when testing our application."
