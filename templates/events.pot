msgid "Laravel's events provide a simple observer pattern implementation, allowing you to subscribe and listen for various events that occur within your application. Event classes are typically stored in the `app/Events` directory, while their listeners are stored in `app/Listeners`. Don't worry if you don't see these directories in your application as they will be created for you as you generate events and listeners using Artisan console commands."

msgid "Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application, since a single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other. For example, you may wish to send a Slack notification to your user each time an order has shipped. Instead of coupling your order processing code to your Slack notification code, you can raise an `App\\Events\\OrderShipped` event which a listener can receive and use to dispatch a Slack notification."
