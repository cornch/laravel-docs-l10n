By getting to know the overall framework better, everything feels less \"magical\" and you will be more confident building your applications. If you don't understand all of the terms right away, don't lose heart! Just try to get a basic grasp of what is going on, and your knowledge will grow as you explore other sections of the documentation."

msgid "Next, the incoming request is sent to either the HTTP kernel or the console kernel, depending on the type of request that is entering the application. These two kernels serve as the central location that all requests flow through. For now, let's just focus on the HTTP kernel, which is located in `app/Http/Kernel.php`."
msgstr ""

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 16 (paragraph)
msgid "The HTTP kernel extends the `Illuminate\\Foundation\\Http\\Kernel` class, which defines an array of `bootstrappers` that will be run before the request is executed. These bootstrappers configure error handling, configure logging, [detect the application environment](/docs/{{version}}/configuration#environment-configuration), and perform other tasks that need to be done before the request is actually handled. Typically, these classes handle internal Laravel configuration that you do not need to worry about."
msgstr ""

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 17 (paragraph)
msgid "The HTTP kernel also defines a list of HTTP [middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware) that all requests must pass through before being handled by the application. These middleware handle reading and writing the [HTTP session](/docs/{{version}}/session), determining if the application is in maintenance mode, [verifying the CSRF token](/docs/{{version}}/csrf), and more. We'll talk more about these soon."

msgstr ""

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 22 (paragraph)
msgid "Laravel will iterate through this list of providers and instantiate each of them. After instantiating the providers, the `register` method will be called on all of the providers.

This is so service providers may depend on every container binding being registered and available by the time their `boot` method is executed."

msgid "Service providers are responsible for bootstrapping all of the framework's various components, such as the database, queue, validation, and routing components. Essentially every major feature offered by Laravel is bootstrapped and configured by a service provider. Since they bootstrap and configure so many features offered by the framework, service providers are the most important aspect of the entire Laravel bootstrap process."

msgstr ""

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 27 (paragraph)
msgid "Once the application has been bootstrapped and all service providers have been registered, the `Request` will be handed off to the router for dispatching. The router will dispatch the request to a route or controller, as well as run any route specific middleware."
msgstr ""

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 28 (paragraph)
msgid "Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering or examining HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies if the user of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware will redirect the user to the login screen. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application. Some middleware are assigned to all routes within the application, like those defined in the `$middleware` property of your HTTP kernel, while some are only assigned to specific routes or route groups. You can learn more about middleware by reading the complete [middleware documentation](/docs/{{version}}/middleware)."
msgstr ""

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 29 (paragraph)

#: docs/8.x/lifecycle.md:block 33 (paragraph)
msgid "Finally, once the response travels back through the middleware, the HTTP kernel's `handle` method returns the response object and the `index.php` file calls the `send` method on the returned response. The `send` method sends the response content to the user's web browser. We've finished our journey through the entire Laravel request lifecycle!"
