msgid "When testing Laravel applications, you may wish to \"mock\" certain aspects of your application so they are not actually executed during a given test. For example, when testing a controller that dispatches an event, you may wish to mock the event listeners so they are not actually executed during the test. This allows you to only test the controller's HTTP response without worrying about the execution of the event listeners since the event listeners can be tested in their own test case."
