msgid "Laravel's events provide a simple observer pattern implementation, allowing you to subscribe and listen for various events that occur within your application. Event classes are typically stored in the `app/Events` directory, while their listeners are stored in `app/Listeners`. Don't worry if you don't see these directories in your application as they will be created for you as you generate events and listeners using Artisan console commands."

#: docs/10.x/events.md:block 6 (paragraph)
msgid "Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application, since a single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other. For example, you may wish to send a Slack notification to your user each time an order has shipped. Instead of coupling your order processing code to your Slack notification code, you can raise an `App\\Events\\OrderShipped` event which a listener can receive and use to dispatch a Slack notification."
