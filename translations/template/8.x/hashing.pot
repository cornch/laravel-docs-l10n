"The Laravel `Hash` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades) provides secure "
"Bcrypt and Argon2 hashing for storing user passwords. If you are using one "
"of the [Laravel application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits), "

"Bcrypt is a great choice for hashing passwords because its \"work factor\" "
"is adjustable, which means that the time it takes to generate a hash can be "
"increased as hardware power increases. When hashing passwords, slow is "
"good. The longer an algorithm takes to hash a password, the longer it takes "
"malicious users to generate \"rainbow tables\" of all possible string hash "
"values that may be used in brute force attacks against applications."
