msgid "First, consider how authentication works. When using a web browser, a user will provide their username and password via a login form. If these credentials are correct, the application will store information about the authenticated user in the user's [session](/docs/{{version}}/session). A cookie issued to the browser contains the session ID so that subsequent requests to the application can associate the user with the correct session. After the session cookie is received, the application will retrieve the session data based on the session ID, note that the authentication information has been stored in the session, and will consider the user as \"authenticated\"."

If the request is not being authenticated via a session cookie, Sanctum will inspect the request for an API token. If an API token is present, Sanctum will authenticate the request using that token.
