msgid "Laravel's encryption services provide a simple, convenient interface for encrypting and decrypting text via OpenSSL using AES-256 and AES-128 encryption. All of Laravel's encrypted values are signed using a message authentication code (MAC) so that their underlying value can not be modified or tampered with once encrypted."

msgid "Before using Laravel's encrypter, you must set the `key` configuration option in your `config/app.php` configuration file. This configuration value is driven by the `APP_KEY` environment variable. You should use the `php artisan key:generate` command to generate this variable's value since the `key:generate` command will use PHP's secure random bytes generator to build a cryptographically secure key for your application. Typically, the value of the `APP_KEY` environment variable will be generated for you during [Laravel's installation](/docs/{{version}}/installation)."
