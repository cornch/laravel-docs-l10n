"To help you learn more about what's happening within your application, "

"Laravel logging is based on \"channels\". Each channel represents a specific "
"way of writing log information. For example, the `single` channel writes log "
"files to a single log file, while the `slack` channel sends log messages to "
"Slack. Log messages may be written to multiple channels based on their "
"severity."

"Under the hood, Laravel utilizes the "
"[Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) library, which provides "
"support for a variety of powerful log handlers. Laravel makes it a cinch to "
