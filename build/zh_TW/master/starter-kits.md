## Introduction

To give you a head start building your new Laravel application, we are happy
to offer authentication and application starter kits. These kits
automatically scaffold your application with the routes, controllers, and
views you need to register and authenticate your application's users.

While you are welcome to use these starter kits, they are not required. You
are free to build your own application from the ground up by simply
installing a fresh copy of Laravel. Either way, we know you will build
something great!

## Laravel Breeze

Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's
[authentication features](/docs/{{version}}/authentication), including
login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password
confirmation. Laravel Breeze's view layer is made up of simple [Blade
templates](/docs/{{version}}/blade) styled with [Tailwind
CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Breeze provides a wonderful starting point
for beginning a fresh Laravel application.

### Installation

First, you should [create a new Laravel
application](/docs/{{version}}/installation), configure your database, and
run your [database migrations](/docs/{{version}}/migrations):

```bash
curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash

cd example-app

php artisan migrate
```

Once you have created a new Laravel application, you may install Laravel
Breeze using Composer:

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
```

After Composer has installed the Laravel Breeze package, you may run the
`breeze:install` Artisan command. This command publishes the authentication
views, routes, controllers, and other resources to your application. Laravel
Breeze publishes all of its code to your application so that you have full
control and visibility over its features and implementation. After Breeze is
installed, you should also compile your assets so that your application's
CSS file is available:

```bash
php artisan breeze:install

npm install

npm run dev
```

Next, you may navigate to your application's `/login` or `/register` URLs in
your web browser. All of Breeze's routes are defined within the
`routes/auth.php` file.

> {tip} To learn more about compiling your application's CSS and JavaScript, check out the [Laravel Mix documentation](/docs/{{version}}/mix#running-mix).

## Laravel Jetstream

While Laravel Breeze provides a simple and minimal starting point for
building a Laravel application, Jetstream augments that functionality with
more robust features and additional frontend technology stacks. **For those
brand new to Laravel, we recommend learning the ropes with Laravel Breeze
before graduating to Laravel Jetstream.**

Jetstream provides a beautifully designed application scaffolding for
Laravel and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor
authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and
optional team management. Jetstream is designed using [Tailwind
CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and offers your choice of
[Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) or
[Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) driven frontend scaffolding.

Complete documentation for installing Laravel Jetstream can be found within
the [official Jetstream
documentation](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/introduction.html).
