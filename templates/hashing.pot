msgid "The Laravel `Hash` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades) provides secure Bcrypt and Argon2 hashing for storing user passwords. If you are using one of the [Laravel application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits), Bcrypt will be used for registration and authentication by default."

msgid "Bcrypt is a great choice for hashing passwords because its \"work factor\" is adjustable, which means that the time it takes to generate a hash can be increased as hardware power increases. When hashing passwords, slow is good. The longer an algorithm takes to hash a password, the longer it takes malicious users to generate \"rainbow tables\" of all possible string hash values that may be used in brute force attacks against applications."
