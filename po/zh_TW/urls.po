msgid "Setting URL default values can interfere with Laravel's handling of implicit model bindings. Therefore, you should [prioritize your middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware#sorting-middleware) that set URL defaults to be executed before Laravel's own `SubstituteBindings` middleware. You can accomplish this by making sure your middleware occurs before the `SubstituteBindings` middleware within the `$middlewarePriority` property of your application's HTTP kernel."
