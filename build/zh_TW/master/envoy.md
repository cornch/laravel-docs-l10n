## Introduction

[Laravel Envoy](https://github.com/laravel/envoy) is a tool for executing
common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using
[Blade](/docs/{{version}}/blade) style syntax, you can easily setup tasks
for deployment, Artisan commands, and more. Currently, Envoy only supports
the Mac and Linux operating systems. However, Windows support is achievable
using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

First, install Envoy into your project using the Composer package manager:

    composer require laravel/envoy --dev

Once Envoy has been installed, the Envoy binary will be available in your
application's `vendor/bin` directory:

    php vendor/bin/envoy

## Writing Tasks

<a name="defining-tasks"></a>
### Defining Tasks

Tasks are the basic building block of Envoy. Tasks define the shell commands
that should execute on your remote servers when the task is invoked. For
example, you might define a task that executes the `php artisan
queue:restart` command on all of your application's queue worker servers.

All of your Envoy tasks should be defined in an `Envoy.blade.php` file at
the root of your application. Here's an example to get you started:

```bash
@servers(['web' => ['user@192.168.1.1'], 'workers' => ['user@192.168.1.2']])

@task('restart-queues', ['on' => 'workers'])
    cd /home/user/example.com
    php artisan queue:restart
@endtask
```

As you can see, an array of `@servers` is defined at the top of the file,
allowing you to reference these servers via the `on` option of your task
declarations. The `@servers` declaration should always be placed on a single
line. Within your `@task` declarations, you should place the shell commands
that should execute on your servers when the task is invoked.

<a name="local-tasks"></a>
#### Local Tasks

You can force a script to run on your local computer by specifying the
server's IP address as `127.0.0.1`:

```bash
@servers(['localhost' => '127.0.0.1'])
```

<a name="importing-envoy-tasks"></a>
#### Importing Envoy Tasks

Using the `@import` directive, you may import other Envoy files so their
stories and tasks are added to yours. After the files have been imported,
you may execute the tasks they contain as if they were defined in your own
Envoy file:

```bash
@import('vendor/package/Envoy.blade.php')
```

<a name="multiple-servers"></a>
### Multiple Servers

Envoy allows you to easily run a task across multiple servers. First, add
additional servers to your `@servers` declaration. Each server should be
assigned a unique name. Once you have defined your additional servers you
may list each of the servers in the task's `on` array:

```bash
@servers(['web-1' => '192.168.1.1', 'web-2' => '192.168.1.2'])

@task('deploy', ['on' => ['web-1', 'web-2']])
    cd /home/user/example.com
    git pull origin {{ $branch }}
    php artisan migrate --force
@endtask
```

<a name="parallel-execution"></a>
#### Parallel Execution

By default, tasks will be executed on each server serially. In other words,
a task will finish running on the first server before proceeding to execute
on the second server. If you would like to run a task across multiple
servers in parallel, add the `parallel` option to your task declaration:

```bash
@servers(['web-1' => '192.168.1.1', 'web-2' => '192.168.1.2'])

@task('deploy', ['on' => ['web-1', 'web-2'], 'parallel' => true])
    cd /home/user/example.com
    git pull origin {{ $branch }}
    php artisan migrate --force
@endtask
```

<a name="setup"></a>
### Setup

Sometimes, you may need to execute arbitrary PHP code before running your
Envoy tasks. You may use the `@setup` directive to define a block of PHP
code that should execute before your tasks:

```php
@setup
    $now = new DateTime;
@endsetup
```

If you need to require other PHP files before your task is executed, you may
use the `@include` directive at the top of your `Envoy.blade.php` file:

```bash
@include('vendor/autoload.php')

@task('restart-queues')
    # ...
@endtask
```

<a name="variables"></a>
### Variables

If needed, you may pass arguments to Envoy tasks by specifying them on the
command line when invoking Envoy:

    php vendor/bin/envoy run deploy --branch=master

You may access the options within your tasks using Blade's "echo"
syntax. You may also define Blade `if` statements and loops within your
tasks. For example, let's verify the presence of the `$branch` variable
before executing the `git pull` command:

```bash
@servers(['web' => ['user@192.168.1.1']])

@task('deploy', ['on' => 'web'])
    cd /home/user/example.com

    @if ($branch)
        git pull origin {{ $branch }}
    @endif

    php artisan migrate --force
@endtask
```

<a name="stories"></a>
### Stories

Stories group a set of tasks under a single, convenient name. For instance,
a `deploy` story may run the `update-code` and `install-dependencies` tasks
by listing the task names within its definition:

```bash
@servers(['web' => ['user@192.168.1.1']])

@story('deploy')
    update-code
    install-dependencies
@endstory

@task('update-code')
    cd /home/user/example.com
    git pull origin master
@endtask

@task('install-dependencies')
    cd /home/user/example.com
    composer install
@endtask
```

Once the story has been written, you may invoke it in the same way you would
invoke a task:

    php vendor/bin/envoy run deploy

<a name="running-tasks"></a>
## Running Tasks

To run a task or story that is defined in your application's
`Envoy.blade.php` file, execute Envoy's `run` command, passing the name of
the task or story you would like to execute. Envoy will execute the task and
display the output from your remote servers as the task is running:

    php vendor/bin/envoy run deploy

<a name="confirming-task-execution"></a>
### Confirming Task Execution

If you would like to be prompted for confirmation before running a given
task on your servers, you should add the `confirm` directive to your task
declaration. This option is particularly useful for destructive operations:

```bash
@task('deploy', ['on' => 'web', 'confirm' => true])
    cd /home/user/example.com
    git pull origin {{ $branch }}
    php artisan migrate
@endtask
```

<a name="notifications"></a>
## Notifications

<a name="slack"></a>
### Slack

Envoy supports sending notifications to [Slack](https://slack.com) after
each task is executed. The `@slack` directive accepts a Slack hook URL and a
channel / user name. You may retrieve your webhook URL by creating an
"Incoming WebHooks" integration in your Slack control panel.

You should pass the entire webhook URL as the first argument given to the
`@slack` directive. The second argument given to the `@slack` directive
should be a channel name (`#channel`) or a user name (`@user`):

    @finished
        @slack('webhook-url', '#bots')
    @endfinished

<a name="discord"></a>
### Discord

Envoy also supports sending notifications to [Discord](https://discord.com)
after each task is executed. The `@discord` directive accepts a Discord hook
URL and a message. You may retrieve your webhook URL by creating a "Webhook"
in your Server Settings and choosing which channel the webhook should post
to. You should pass the entire Webhook URL into the `@discord` directive:

    @finished
        @discord('discord-webhook-url')
    @endfinished

<a name="telegram"></a>
### Telegram

Envoy also supports sending notifications to
[Telegram](https://telegram.org) after each task is executed. The
`@telegram` directive accepts a Telegram Bot ID and a Chat ID. You may
retrieve your Bot ID by creating a new bot using
[BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). You can retrieve a valid Chat ID using
[@username_to_id_bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot). You should pass the
entire Bot ID and Chat ID into the `@telegram` directive:

    @finished
        @telegram('bot-id','chat-id')
    @endfinished
