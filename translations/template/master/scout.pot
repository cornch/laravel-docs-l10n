"[Laravel Scout](https://github.com/laravel/scout) provides a simple, driver "

"Currently, Scout ships with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), "

"that is designed for local development usage and does not require any "
"external dependencies or third-party services. Furthermore, writing custom "
"drivers is simple and you are free to extend Scout with your own search "
