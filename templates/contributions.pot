Pull requests will only be reviewed when marked as \"ready for review\" (not in the \"draft\" state) and all tests for new features are passing. Lingering, non-active pull requests left in the \"draft\" state will be closed after a few days."

Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem. If you want to chip in, you can help out by fixing [any bugs listed in our issue trackers](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+user%3Alaravel).
