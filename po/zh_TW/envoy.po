msgid "[Laravel Envoy](https://github.com/laravel/envoy) is a tool for executing common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using [Blade](/docs/{{version}}/blade) style syntax, you can easily setup tasks for deployment, Artisan commands, and more. Currently, Envoy only supports the Mac and Linux operating systems. However, Windows support is achievable using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)."
