msgid "In many modern web applications, WebSockets are used to implement realtime, live-updating user interfaces. When some data is updated on the server, a message is typically sent over a WebSocket connection to be handled by the client. WebSockets provide a more efficient alternative to continually polling your application's server for data changes that should be reflected in your UI."

However, creating this CSV file takes several minutes so you choose to create and mail the CSV within a [queued job](/docs/{{version}}/queues). When the CSV has been created and mailed to the user, we can use event broadcasting to dispatch an `App\\Events\\UserDataExported` event that is received by our application's JavaScript. Once the event is received, we can display a message to the user that their CSV has been emailed to them without them ever needing to refresh the page."
