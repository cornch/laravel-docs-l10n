"Laravel's events provide a simple observer pattern implementation, allowing "
"you to subscribe and listen for various events that occur within your "
"application. Event classes are typically stored in the `app/Events` "
"directory, while their listeners are stored in `app/Listeners`. Don't worry "
"if you don't see these directories in your application as they will be "
"created for you as you generate events and listeners using Artisan console "
"commands."

"Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application, "
"since a single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each "
"other. For example, you may wish to send a Slack notification to your user "
"each time an order has shipped. Instead of coupling your order processing "
"code to your Slack notification code, you can raise an "
"`App\\Events\\OrderShipped` event which a listener can receive and use to "
"dispatch a Slack notification."
