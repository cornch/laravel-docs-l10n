Using a one-to-one polymorphic relation allows you to have a single table of unique images that may be associated with posts and users. First, let's examine the table structure:"
msgstr "多型的一對一關聯於一般的一對一關聯類似。不過，在這種關聯中的子 Model 可以使用一種關聯來表示出對超過一種 Model 的從屬關係。舉例來說，部落格的 `Post` (貼文) 與 `User` (使用者) 可能會共享一個多型關聯的 `Image` (圖片) Model。使用多型的一對一關聯，就能讓我們製作一張用來儲存不重複圖片的資料表，並將該資料表關聯到貼文跟使用者上。首先，我們來看看下列資料表架構："

The `imageable_id` column will contain the ID value of the post or user, while the `imageable_type` column will contain the class name of the parent model. The `imageable_type` column is used by Eloquent to determine which \"type\" of parent model to return when accessing the `imageable` relation. In this case, the column would contain either `App\\Models\\Post` or `App\\Models\\User`."
msgstr "可以注意到 `images` 資料表上的 `imageable_id` 與 `imageable_type` 欄位。`imageable_id` 欄位用來包含貼文或使用者的 ID 值，而 `imageable_type` 欄位則用來包含上層 Model 的類別名稱。`imageable_type` 是用來給 Eloquent 判斷上層 Model 的「型別 (Type)」，以在存取 `imageable` 關聯時能回傳該上層 Model。在這種情況下，這個欄位的內容會是 `App\\Models\\Post` 或 `App\\Models\\User`。"
