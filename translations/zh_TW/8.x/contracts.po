"Laravel's \"contracts\" are a set of interfaces that define the core "
"services provided by the framework. For example, an `Illuminate\\Contracts"
"\\Queue\\Queue` contract defines the methods needed for queueing jobs, while "
"the `Illuminate\\Contracts\\Mail\\Mailer` contract defines the methods "
"needed for sending e-mail."

#. type: Plain text

"Each contract has a corresponding implementation provided by the framework. "

"Laravel's [facades](/docs/{{version}}/facades) and helper functions provide "

"Unlike facades, which do not require you to require them in your class' "

"this way and therefore prefer to use contracts, while other developers enjoy "
"the convenience of facades. **In general, most applications can use facades "

"The decision to use contracts or facades will come down to personal taste "
"and the tastes of your development team. Both contracts and facades can be "
"used to create robust, well-tested Laravel applications. Contracts and "
"facades are not mutually exclusive. Some parts of your applications may use "
"facades while others depend on contracts. As long as you are keeping your "
"class' responsibilities focused, you will notice very few practical "
"differences between using contracts and facades."

"In general, most applications can use facades without issue during "

"Laravel's concrete implementations in your package's `composer.json` file."
