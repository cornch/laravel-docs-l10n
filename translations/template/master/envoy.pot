"[Laravel Envoy](https://github.com/laravel/envoy) is a tool for executing "
"common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using "
"[Blade](/docs/{{version}}/blade) style syntax, you can easily setup tasks "
"for deployment, Artisan commands, and more. Currently, Envoy only supports "
"the Mac and Linux operating systems. However, Windows support is achievable "
"using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)."
